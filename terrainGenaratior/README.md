# Three.js Terrain Visualization

This project demonstrates a dynamic 3D terrain visualization using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Simplex Noise](https://github.com/jwagner/simplex-noise.js). The terrain dynamically evolves over time, creating a wave-like effect.

## Demo

Check out the live demo [here](https://shekilrahman.github.io/terrainGenaratior/).

## Features

- Real-time 3D terrain rendering
- Dynamic wave-like terrain animation
- Responsive design that adjusts to window resizing

## Technologies Used

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - A JavaScript 3D library
- [Simplex Noise](https://github.com/jwagner/simplex-noise.js) - A library for generating coherent noise

## Getting Started
